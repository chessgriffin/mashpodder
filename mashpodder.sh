### START USER CONFIGURATION
# Default values can be set here. Command-line flags can override some of
# these but not all of them.

# BASEDIR: Base location of the script and related files.  If you have an
# escaped space in the directory name be sure to keep the double quotes.
# Default is "$HOME/mashpodder".  This is commented out on purpose to start
# with in order to force the user to review this USER CONFIGURATION section
# and set the various options. Uncomment and set to desired path.
# Mashpodder will not create this directory for you.
#BASEDIR="$HOME/mashpodder"

# RSSFILE: Location of mp.conf file.  Can be changed to another file name.
# Default is "$BASEDIR/mp.conf".
RSSFILE="$BASEDIR/mp.conf"

# PODCASTDIR: Location of podcast directories listed in $RSSFILE.  If you
# have an escaped space in the directory name be sure to keep the double
# quotes.  Default is "$BASEDIR/podcasts".  Thanks to startrek.steve for
# reporting the issues that led to these directory changes.  Mashpodder will
# create this directory if it does not exist unless $CREATE_PODCASTDIR is
# set to "".
PODCASTDIR="$BASEDIR/podcasts"

# CREATE_PODCASTDIR: Default "1" will create the directory for you if it
# does not exist; "" means to fail and exit if $PODCASTDIR does not exist.
# If your podcast directory is on a mounted share (e.g. NFS, Samba), then
# setting this to "" and thus fail is a means of detecting an unmounted
# share, and to avoid unintentionally writing to the mount point.  (This
# assumes that $PODCASTDIR is below, and not, the mount point.)
CREATE_PODCASTDIR="1"

# DATEFILEDIR: Location of the "date" directory below $PODCASTDIR
# Note: do not use a leading slash, it will get added later.  The
# eventual location will be $PODCASTDIR/$DATEFILEDIR/$(date +$DATESTRING)
# Mashpodder will create this directory if it does not exist.
# Default is "", which results in date directories being put in $PODCASTDIR.
DATEFILEDIR=""

# TMPDIR: Location of temp logs, where files are temporarily downloaded to,
# and other bits.  If you have an escaped space in the directory name be
# sure to keep the double quotes.  Mashpodder will create this directory if
# it does not exist but it will not be deleted on exit.  Default is
# "$BASEDIR/tmp".
TMPDIR="$BASEDIR/tmp"

# DATESTRING: Valid date format for date-based archiving.  Can be changed
# to other valid formats.  See man date.  Default is "%Y%m%d".
DATESTRING="%Y%m%d"

# PARSE_ENCLOSURE: Location of parse_enclosure.xsl file.  Default is
# "$BASEDIR/parse_enclosure.xsl".
PARSE_ENCLOSURE="$BASEDIR/parse_enclosure.xsl"

# PODLOG: This is a critical file.  This is the file that saves the name of
# every file downloaded (or checked with the 'update' option in mp.conf.)
# If you lose this file then mashpodder should be able to automatically
# recreate it during the next run, but it's still a good idea to make sure
# the file is kept in a safe place.  Default is "$BASEDIR/podcast.log".
PODLOG="$BASEDIR/podcast.log"

# PODLOG_BACKUP: Setting this option to "1" will create a date-stamped
# backup of your podcast.log file before new podcast files are downloaded.
# The filename will be $PODLOG.$DATESTRING (see above variables).  If you
# enable this, you'll want to monitor the number of backups and manually
# remove old copies.  Default is "".
PODLOG_BACKUP=""

# FIRST_ONLY: Default "" means look to mp.conf for whether to download or
# update; "1" will override mp.conf and download the newest episode.
FIRST_ONLY=""

# M3U: Default "" means no m3u playlist created; "1" will create m3u
# playlists in each podcast's directory listing all the files in that
# directory.
M3U=""

# DAILY_PLAYLIST: Default "" means no daily m3u playlist created; "1" will
# create an m3u playlist in $PODCASTDIR listing all newly downloaded
# shows.  The m3u filename will have the $DATESTRING prepended to it and
# additional new downloads for that day will be added to the file.  NOTE:
# $M3U must also be set to "1" for this to work.
DAILY_PLAYLIST=""

# UPDATE: Default "" means look to mp.conf on whether to download or
# update; "1" will override mp.conf and cause all feeds to be updated
# (meaning episodes will be marked as downloaded but not actually
# downloaded).
UPDATE=""

# VERBOSE: Default "" is quiet output; "1" is verbose.
VERBOSE=""

# WGET_QUIET: Default is "-q" for quiet wget output; change to "" for wget
# output.
WGET_QUIET="-q"

# WGET_TIMEOUT: Default is 30 seconds; can decrease or increase if some
# files are cut short. Thanks to Phil Smith for the bug report.
WGET_TIMEOUT="30"

# Location of binaries.  Below are the paths to third-party binaries used by
# mashpodder.  This is here for BSD users where these binaries are usually in
# /usr/local/bin.  Defaults are Linux locations (i.e. /usr/bin).
WGET=${WGET:-"/usr/bin/wget"}
CURL=${CURL:-"/usr/bin/curl"}
XSLTPROC=${XSLTPROC:-"/usr/bin/xsltproc"}

$SCRIPT
Usage: $0 [OPTIONS] <arguments>
Options are:

-b              Create a date-stamped backup of the podcast.log file.

-c <filename>   Use a different config file other than mp.conf.

-d <date>       Valid date string for date-based archiving.  See man date.

-f              Override mp.conf and download the first new episode.

-h              Display this help message.

-m              Create m3u playlists.

-u              Override mp.conf and only update (mark downloaded).

-v              Display verbose messages.

mp.conf is the standard configuration file.  Please see the sample mp.conf for
how this file is to be configured.

Some -- but not all -- of the default settings can be set permanently at the
top of the script in the 'USER CONFIGURATION' section or temporarily by passing
a command line switch.  The 'USER CONFIGURATION' section also has additional
things you can set that do not have compatible command-line switches.

Therefore, reading mashpodder.sh is recommended.
